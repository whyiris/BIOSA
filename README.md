##### Authors: Lisa, Conard, Wai, Sheng, Hoi Yan
--------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description:
The goal of the project is to build the foundation and tools needed to develop and to analyze mutational differences between reference DNA sequences and samples.
Evidences from the input “GenomeDiff” files are utilized to conduct additional computational analysis of experiments that supports mutations.
Additionally, a REST API is provided for database access using the browser, and other applications that need the data.


## Requirements:
1. NodeJS v9.5.0
2. mongoDB v3.6.2
3. nodemon


## How to Install:
1. $ git clone https://github.com/LeesaCodes/BioSA.git
2. $ cd BioSA
3. $ npm install


## How to Run:
1. Start mongoDB server, $ mongod
2. Open a new terminal, $ node server.js
3. Connect using the browser at http://localhost:3001


## Organization
